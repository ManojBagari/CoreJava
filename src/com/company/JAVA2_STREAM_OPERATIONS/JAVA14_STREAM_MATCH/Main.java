/*
        The Streams API supports different types of match operations on stream elements.

        The following methods in the Stream interface are used to perform match operations:

        boolean allMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
        boolean anyMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
        boolean noneMatch(Predicate<? super  T> predicate)

        The primitive type streams such as
        IntStream, LongStream, and DoubleStream
        also contain the same methods that work
        with a predicate and an optional one for primitive types.

        All match operations are terminal operations.
        They are also short-circuiting operations.
        A short-circuiting operation may not have
        to process the entire stream to return the result.

        The following code shows how to perform match operations on streams.
